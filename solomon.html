                            My name is Solomon Chang and I am currently a Junior studying Biomedical Engineering
                            at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Since the beginning of my time at the 
                            University of Michigan, I was apart of a learning community Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars (MRADS) 
                            learning different research methods that were done at the University of Michigan. Then became a mentor helping out 
                            the incoming freshman to learn more about the University and guiding the research process. Throughout the process
                            I was also conducting bone regeneration research specifically focusing on the role of MicroRNA's effect on bone regeneration.
                            I was also apart of a design team Making Safe and Assessable Exams (MESA) working in a multidisciplinary team trying to build 
                            a gynecological table for underdeveloped communities. During which I acquired a bunch of technical skills including 
                            CAD, ANYS, Milling, and a bunch of laboratory skills.I have also attended a NASA hackaton and was apart of a team that created 
                            a "hotspot" map to help peopl determine if there region is considered a hot spot. We conducted extensive research 
                            and I was able to enhance my html skills. I am intrested in product manager roles and also Biomedical Engineering 
                            Research and Design roles.
